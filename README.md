# Mynode App

CRUD Products RESTfull API with NodeJs and MongoDb.

## Installation

1. Clone repository with `git clone https://github.com/alramdein/restful-api-nodejs-mongodb.git`
2. On the root project, run `npm install`
3. Run your Mongodb server with `mongod`.<br/> 
*The MongoDb server should be listen on `mongodb://localhost:27017/mynode`. Or you can change it on `src/config/database.config.js`. More about [getting started with MongoDb](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-mongodb-a4ce205e7739/)*
4. Still on the root project, run app with `npm start` command.
5. The app would served in `http://localhost:4000/`

## Usage

To test the API, I recommend using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/). 

**Routes:**
1. POST `/api/v1/products` add products
